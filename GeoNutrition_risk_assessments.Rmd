# Introduction

Micronutrient deficiencies, also known as MNDs or "hidden hunger," continue to be a global issue, particularly among the rural poor who lack access to supplements like Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs), biofortified crops, or a diverse diet. This is especially true for subsistence farmers and pastoralists in Sub-Saharan Africa who rely on locally grown food (see e.g., [Stevens, et al., 2022](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2822%2900367-9)). The physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the soil on which crops are grown and livestock are grazed play a crucial role in trophic dynamics, nutrient transfers across food system boundaries, and overall dietary quality for people. However, there are significant data and information constraints when it comes to reducing MNDs in SSA. These include a lack of spatial baseline and monitoring data on the distribution of recurrent or chronic MNDs, limited national research capacity to gather evidence for local nutrient management, and the use of untested nutrient management recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders.

This use case document focuses on previously tested data science workflows for GeoNutrition risk assessments at the national level in Africa. The goal is to establish nutrient management practices that are specific to crop and livestock production needs, based on soil and food system conditions. These practices are expected to increase the yields and nutritional quality of food and fodder, resulting in increased returns for smallholder farmers and pastoralists. The document outlines various high-value information products that will result from these workflows, including accurate land cover/land use databases, maps and monitoring products databases documenting the distribution and bioavailability of essential nutrients. These information products can be used to generate agricultural input recommendations for the main African food systems. By using new field, laboratory, remote sensing, and modeling approaches, GeoNutrition work can be accomplished in a collaborative, cost-effective manner, with a focus on effective resource use for data system establishment, acquisition, analyses, and national capacity and awareness building.

# GeoNutrition data collections

## Defining food systems of interest

Quantifying the geographical extent, location and spatial dynamics of food systems, croplands, rural and urban settlements and different types of vegetation cover provides essential information for monitoring and managing human dominated landscapes. Large portions of Africa remain a virtual "terra incognita" in this context. The main reason for monitoring [land cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_cover) is to assess where in a particular country or region of interest significant impacts of humans on ecosystem services can be expected within different land cover / use classes, and *vice versa*. **[GeoSurvey](https://geosurvey.qed.ai/)** is an application for rapidly collecting and analyzing [land cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_cover) observations at low cost. High resolution satellite images and/or other aerial (e.g., aircraft or drone) imagery can be systematically and rapidly labeled by either trained image interpreters and/or by vetted *crowds* of [Citizen Scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science). When done with care, these observations can result in large, well-structured, properly labeled, geospatial data sets that are suitable for data mining, machine learning and geostatistical predictions of land cover, and in some instances land use. Fig. 2 shows some recently labeled examples from Rwanda.

The detailed manual for conducting your own GeoSurveys is available from [QED.ai](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-HYUSYpDVESPdmEcl3I2kuL0bwrT41wMiq0zE9uzOs/edit). The manual should definitely be consulted to obtain more information about how GeoSurvey can be used to carry out potentially high value land cover surveys of remote areas. There is also a great slide deck available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vBQ-By8LLvyJQzMBFaqUuRwFFeL7Y8QXUtBifx-3jn4/edit#slide=id.g14d47405c8_0_0), which illustrates different labeling approaches. A new companion multilabel land cover classification notebook for Malawi is **[available here](https://africasoils.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Stacked_multilabel_lccs.html)**. It describes how GeoSurvey data can be used to accurately delineate the cropland regions of a country that are typically of main interest in GeoNutrition work. The workflow can, and has been, extended to map other land cover / land use variables e.g., the density of buildings, soil conservation and irrigation infrastructure, and (some) types of crop distributions, e.g., paddy rice, oil palm, woodlots and orchards, tea and coffee, among others. It can be rapidly extended to cover additional geographies with new observations, and/or alternative machine learning models (see Fig. 3). There are also quite a few additional examples for other African countries available at: **[GeoSurvey data prediction workflows](https://osf.io/vxc97/)**.

## Specifying a sampling frame

Once a suitable ROI has been identified (e.g., Fig. 3), selecting an appropriate sampling frame for ground observations and measurements and/or experiments is a critical planning step for GeoNutrition projects. This determines both the main and recurrent costs of any mapping, monitoring and experimental programs as well as the resulting precision and accuracy of the predictions that are made about the prevalence and incidence of MNDs. It should also be completely reproducible. We generally favor spatially balanced sampling ([Deville and Tillé, 2004](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/91/4/893/459329?redirectedFrom=fulltext)) at the national in this context, which allows sampling based on the relevant inclusion probabilities, while aiming for balance and spread with respect to speciﬁed covariates and/or constraints. 

A recent example of a spatially balanced sampling frame for the RwaSIS project is **[available here](https://africasoils.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/RwaSIS_cropland_sample.html)**. In Rwanda, ground survey sites falling within the cropland ROI, determined from GeoSurvey predictions, were selected for spatial balance, which entails that the mean coordinates of sample sites are close to the mean coordinates of all points in the sample frame, and which have adequate spatial spread ([Grafström and Schelin, 2014](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BalancedSampling/index.html)). The data frame that is generated is also written as a `.csv` file, which can be used as waypoint input to a GPS (e.g., with [GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org)), tablet or smart phone for ground navigation. Please take a look at the notebook, and feel free to alter it for your own surveys and experiments.

## Field surveys

Maintaining data consistency from the field to the lab to various databases and physical archives is paramount for any GeoNutrition risk analyses. We describe the basic steps and standard operating procedures in our basic **[Field sampling SOPs](https://africasoils.info/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AfSIS_field_sampling_SOP.html)** document, which should be consulted before taking any soil, plant or livestock biomarker samples and for collecting their correct metadata and sample IDs. The document also provides links to the Android field data collection forms, which have been widely tested in Africa, and that we use currently: **[Crop Scout](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info/#/forms/a3jwzkBTtDvdaZJgR6YjAe/landing)** (Fig. 4) and **[Soil Sample](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info/#/forms/aQRGYv5ZcbY6ow4UxxFe5b/landing)**.

knitr::include_graphics("Crop_scout.jpg")
```

We recommend that you download these 2 forms and incorporate those in your sample collection processes. This will allow you to harmonize your data with existing and any new data collections in Africa. You can also alter those to suit your specific needs, including for the collection of geological, water, and/or livestock biomarker samples. All data recording, plant and soil sampling tasks should be conducted by professional survey crews, who are thoroughly trained in the respective field survey safety and operating procedures. Survey crews should use their discretion to exclude sample sites that might jeopardize their safety, create disproportionately expensive detours for sample collections in difficult terrain and/or under otherwise hazardous conditions. Crew safety must come first!

## Lab work

Based on our experience, the primary instruments in field and national labs should be the mid-infrared (MIR) and X-ray fluorescence ([XRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence)) spectrometers (Fig. 5). Spectral signatures of rocks, soils, water, plants, animal tissues generally are defined by their reflectance or absorbance as a function of wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. Under laboratory conditions, the signatures result from electronic transitions of atoms and vibrational stretching and bending of structural groups of atoms that form molecules or crystals. Spectroscopy has been shown to provide highly repeatable, rapid, and low-cost measurements of different soil, plant, and animal biomarker properties in numerous studies. The amount of light absorbed by a rock, soil, plant or animal tissue sample can be measured with minimal sample preparation (primarily drying and grinding) across a wide range of wavelengths to provide unique spectral signatures. Individual measurements can be performed in about 15-90 seconds, in stark contrast to more conventional soil and plant tests, which are typically slow, labor-intensive, expensive, and/or use hazardous chemicals, which have to be handled carefully by laboratories.

```

The nutrient status (mineral nutrient and trace element compositions) of soils, plants and livestock biomarkers are commonly expressed by total element analyses. We recommend that all soil, plant and/or livestock samples for GeoNutrition assessments should be analyzed with high-throughput, near and mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. A ~10-15% reference subset of all soil and crop samples should be analyzed for essential plant macronutrients (P, K, S, Ca, Mg), essential plant micronutrients (B, Cl, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni, Co) and essential animal trace minerals (Cr, F, I, Se, Si, Na, V) contents using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Soil C and N can be measured by dry combustion on a CN-analyzer. Additional soil reference analyses for e.g., pH and exchangeable acidity, Mehlich-3 extractable nutrients and soil physical properties can be linked to this minimum dataset as needed. The reference measurements will be used for calibrating machine-learning and geostatistical models for predicting nutrient contents and transfers between soils and plants based on much more rapid and less costly MIR & XRF spectroscopy measurements.

## Field experiments

The basic GeoNutrition use case (Sections 2.1 - 2.4 above) can be readily extended to include a variety of “randomized-controlled” management trials ([RCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial)). By adding the relevant field, laboratory measurements and analysis procedures, one would significantly enhance and extend interpretations of the effects soil, plant and livestock conditions that may be captured by such experiments. 

However, the implementation of RCTs beyond [case study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study) scales is fairly expensive (@ ~150 – 650 U$ per trial season, depending on experimental setups), as well as being seasonally time constrained, and therefore rate limiting. So, these need to be planned and executed quite carefully to be cost and information effective at scale. We therefore recommend working with the designated national authorities as well as international partners to co-develop, cost share and coordinate information efficient RCTs across a representative range of environmental conditions in the specified region(s) of potential GeoNutritional interest.

Also because multi-locational-by-seasonal RCTs would presumably run beyond reconnaissance time frames, we also recommend that such activities are carried out routinely and reproducibly by national teams using a coordinated, longer-term, regional sampling plans. We also recommend to set up data warehouses and model repositories and systematically stress test all the relevant procedures and workflows in the field and with national labs and international collaborators.

# Dietary reference intakes

## Definitions

Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are a set of nutrient intake recommendations established by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine ([NASEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine)) to guide healthy eating patterns for individuals in the United States and Canada. DRIs are based on scientific research and reflect the current state of knowledge about nutrient requirements and the relationship between nutrients and health. The purpose of DRIs is to provide guidance for the development of healthy eating patterns that promote optimal health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.

DRIs can be used to assess and plan diets for individuals, as well as to develop public health policies and programs. Overall, DRIs provide a framework for understanding the nutrient needs of different population groups and can help individuals make informed decisions about their diets to support optimal health and well-being. DRIs consist of three main values:

* The Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) are the average daily nutrient intake levels that are estimated to meet the needs of half of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.

* Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the daily nutrient intake levels that are sufficient to meet the needs of nearly all individuals (97-98%) in a particular life stage and gender group.

* Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) are the highest daily nutrient intake levels that are likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.

DRIs are divided into different life stage and gender groups, including infants, children, adolescents, adults, pregnant and lactating women. They may also be further differentiated by body mass index, and activity levels. Check out your personal DRIs with: [**DRI calculator**](https://africasoils.info/about-dietary-reference-intakes-dris/).

```

There are some important points about DRIs to keep in mind: (1.) DRIs apply to healthy people and do not pertain to those who are sick or malnourished or whose special circumstances may alter their nutrient needs, (2.) an individual’s requirement for a specific nutrient is unknown, and (3.) using the DRIs for assessment and planning is most effective when conducted as a cyclical activity that comprises assessment, planning, implementation, and reassessment ([Institutes of Medicine, 2006](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11537/dietary-reference-intakes-the-essential-guide-to-nutrient-requirements)).

## Daily values for micronutrients

Daily Values (DVs) for micronutrients such as for example iron and zinc are based on the recommendations established by the [National Academy of Medicine (NAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences. The NAM sets the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for each nutrient based on gender, and life stage.

The DVs of iron and zinc, as well as other micronutrients, are based on the RDAs and are used to provide information on the nutrient content of foods. For example, the DV for iron is set at 18 mg/day for adults and children over 4 years of age, while the DV for zinc is set at 11 mg/day for adults and children over 4 years of age ([FDA, 2016](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).

The DVs for iron and zinc are used to calculate the percent Daily Value (%DV), which appears on the Nutrition Facts panel of food labels in the United States and Canada. For example, a serving of food that contains 3 mg of iron would provide 17% of the DV for iron (3 ÷ 18 × 100 = 17), while a serving of food that contains 2 mg of zinc would provide 18% of the DV for zinc (2 ÷ 11 × 100 = 18) ([USDA, 2020](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).

# Predicting potential MNDs

> *"The [Rashomon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect) is a storytelling and writing method in cinema in which an event is given contradictory interpretations or descriptions by the individuals involved, thereby providing different perspectives and points of view of the same incident. The term, derived from the 1950 film Rashomon (directed by Akira Kurosawa), is used to describe the phenomenon of the unreliability of eyewitnesses."* -- also see: [Anderson (2016)](https://cjc.utpjournals.press/doi/10.22230/cjc.2016v41n2a3068).
